# Map Reduce
This program implements the MapReduce paradigm to process large text files efficiently. It organizes words based on their first letter and indexes the files in which they appear. The program is highly optimized for performance and is multi-threaded, ensuring fast processing even for massive datasets. The Map phase maps words to their first letter, and the Reduce phase groups them accordingly. By using a multi-threaded approach, the program significantly enhances processing speed and handles large volumes of text with ease, making it both efficient and scalable for large-scale text processing tasks.
